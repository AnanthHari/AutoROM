Due to a recent legal issue, OpenAI is no longer able to include Atari ROM files in their Gym library (or more specifically ALE-Py, which Gym depends on). This requires users to add the needed the ROMs themselves. This library automatically downloads ROM into the ALE-Py folder in a very simple manner.

To use:

```
pip3 install autorom
AutoROM
```
